### Course Description
* An introduction to programming using the C language. See [Lectures](#lectures) for topics covered.

### Textbook
* A book on C programming, 4th ed.; Al Kelley and Ira Pohl. __ISBN 0-201-18399-4__

### Recommended Textbooks
Although these books are not required they might be referenced throughout the course and they are some of my favorite programming books in C. If you plan on continuing with your programming education they will be great resources. You can also browse them at the NYU Library. 

* The C Programming Language, 2nd ed.; Kernighan and Ritchie. __ISBN 0-13-110362-8__
* Programming Pearls, 2nd ed.; Jon Bentley.  __ISBN 0-201-11889-0__


### Purpose
The goal of this course is to teach you a pragmatic understanding of the C programming language. It will avoid the esoteric and the rarely features of the language.

### How to Succeed
* Attend lectures
    - Many topics / examples / questions which will appear on the exams and in the homework will be covered in lectures but not necessarily within the textbook. 
* Participate in lecture by asking questions
    - Ask questions! It's the quickest way to learn. All questions will be answered and respected. 
* Study the language
    - Don't simply read the textbook / attend lectures. Study the concepts and ideas to get a firm understanding of them and why they are the way they are in the C language in particular. For example, if you _know_ about Hashtables don't assume you already understand them in C. There are peculiarities to every language and learning those for C is part of this course. 
* Program with the language
    - Studying the language is not sufficient for C or any other programming language. To actually become proficient in a language you must use it and use it extensively.
* Read others' code
    - In addition to studying and programming with a language, it is extremely important to read others' code in that language when learning it. There are common paradigms and principals that others have developed over time by virtual of working within the confines of the C language. You can learn these patterns by reading others' code.  Github is an amazing resource for this.

### Participation

Ask as many questions as you have. I would encourage you to ask the questions in class by raising your hand. If you have a question, chances are, at least one other person has the same question. 

### GitHub Usage

This class will use [GitHub](http://github.com) extensively. All lectures, homework assignments and discussion will happen on the class's [repository](https://github.com/NYU-CS2164/Spring-2016);
To read more about the benefits to this for you as a student, read [here](https://education.github.com/)

You must notify me of your GitHub user id. As soon as you do, I will verify that you're enrolled in the class, and then give you access to the class's private [repository](https://github.com/NYU-CS2164/Spring-2016).  The repository is [Spring-2016](https://github.com/NYU-CS2164/Spring-2016). If you do not have access you will get a 404 message. This means either;
* you haven't given me your GitHub user id
* I have not yet added you
* or you are not logged-in with that user id.

Ensure you have access to this [repository](https://github.com/NYU-CS2164/Spring-2016) __ASAP (as soon as possible)__

Upon getting access you must [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) the repository. This will give you write access to a copied version owned by your user. 

### Homework

There will be __11__ homework assignments.  I will throw out the lowest score. This allows for some cushion in case you are unavailable to work on an assignment, are late, get a bad grade or for whatever reason do not finish an assignment.

Homework assignments will be posted immediately after lecture. They will be due at __5pm__ the day of the next lecture (in general, consult the [Grading Schedule](#grading) for any changes)

The process for viewing and submitting homework assignments is:
* I will make the assignment available immediately after the lecture
* You will work on your assignment and commit locally
* The final commit which I'll review for grading will be the latest commit __before 5pm__ the day of the following lecture (i.e., you'll have about one week to complete the assignment)
* Only __after 5pm__ you should push your changes to your forked repository (`git push`) and then issue a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) for your completed work thus making it available for grading.
* Note, the pull request __must be submitted within 24 hours__ of the due date.

__Late submissions are treated as 0__ Submitting an assignment late will not be tolerated in any circumstance. This includes issuing a pull request after the 24 hour deadline of last commit.  If this happens you can use this as your grade which will not be counted.  

__Important__ If any part of this process does not make sense please let me know __ASAP (as soon as possible)__ via e-mail or in the first lecture.

See [Grading](#grading) for dates and overall grade percentage.

### Exams

There will be __2__ exams in total.  
 
* __Midterm__ - this is an in-class exam. It will be written (no computer usage).
* __Final__ - this is an in-class exam. It will be slightly longer than the midterm and will also be written (no computer usage).

See [Grading](#grading) for dates and overall grade percentage.

### Grading

| Activity | Date Due | Overall Grade Percentage |
| :------- | :------: | :----------------------: |
| Homework 1 | 2/3 @ 5 pm | 5% |
| Homework 2 | 2/10 @ 5 pm | 5% |
| Homework 3 | 2/17 @ 5 pm | 5% |
| Homework 4 | 2/24 @ 5 pm | 5% |
| Homework 5 | 3/2 @ 5 pm | 5% |
| Midterm | 3/9 | 20% |
| Homework 6 | 3/23 @ 5 pm | 5% |
| Homework 7 | 3/30 @ 5 pm | 5% |
| Homework 8 | 4/6 @ 5 pm | 5% |
| Homework 9 | 4/13 @ 5 pm | 5% |
| Homework 10 | 4/20 @ 5 pm | 5% |
| Homework 11 | 4/27 @ 5 pm | 5% |
| Final | 5/11 | 30% |

The lowest scoring homework assignment will not be counted.

####Tips for Homework
* Your code must compile and be tested to work. If it does not compile/work it is better to leave a comment explaining as much of what you've done to try to remedy as you may receive partial credit.
* Comment your code. Be descriptive yet succinct.
* Follow as closely as possible the [Gnu Coding StandardsSun Code Conventions](http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/standards.html). 
Mainly:
- All macros and constants in caps: MAX_BUFFER_SIZE, TRACKING_ID_PREFIX.
- Struct names and typedef's in camelcase: GtkWidget, TrackingOrder.
- Functions that operate on structs: classic C style: gtk_widget_show(), tracking_order_process().
- Pointers: nothing fancy here: GtkWidget *foo, TrackingOrder *bar.
- Global variables: just don't use global variables. They are evil.
- Functions that are there, but shouldn't be called directly, or have obscure uses, or whatever: one or more underscores at the beginning: _refrobnicate_data_tables(), _destroy_cache()

### Cheating / Copying Code
Any form of cheating or using others' code will not be tolerated. All work must be original. If two students hand in essentially the same code then __both__ students will receive __0__ for that assignment and also for another assignment (their highest scoring) and may also face further disciplinary action from NYU.     

### Office Hours
If you want to meet me prior to class please email me so that I can ensure I'm available promptly at 1:30pm. If you do not email me in advance I may be late getting to office hours. Additionally, if the office hours' time does not work for you I will make myself available via Google Hangout (video call).  Just send me an email and we can coordinate a time that will work for both of us.


Online Resources

* StackOverflow - http://stackoverflow.com
    - The best place to find and post questions to any and all programming problems. I'm guessing you'll be spending a lot of time on this site while learning C.
